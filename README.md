# weather-symptoms
Beginning of a project to track weather data against headache symptoms &amp; find patterns.  

Users will be able to enter basic data, including a location for each symptom. These will be logged, along with the weather for each node. The surrounding weather data will then be analyzed to find patterns that may predict future symptoms.  

Using [OpenWeatherMap PHP API](https://github.com/cmfcmf/OpenWeatherMap-PHP-Api/tree/master) to connect to [Open Weather Map](http://www.openweathermap.org/).
